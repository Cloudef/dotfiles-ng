# Workaround bug where nvidia-settings --load-config-only
# does not actually load any attributes.
#
# It might be related to values that have decimals such as
# RedBrightness=1.000000
# nvidia-settings will complain about (Trailing garbage), unless ran as root..
#
# However, running as root isn't really a nice thing, so this script just assign everything
# It will still give you complaints about (Trailing garbage), but at least other settings get applied.
#
# This will work as long the configuration file's attributes are in format
# HOSTNAME:DISPLAY/attribute=value
# eg. LINUX:0.0/CursorShadow=0
#
# or
#
# DISPLAY/attribute=value
# eg. 0/CursorShadow=0
#
# If nvidia ever changes their configuration, this script will break obviously :)

main() {
   # Path to nvidia-settings configuration file
   # or custom configuration
   local NVIDIA_SETTINGS_FILE="$HOME/.nvidia-settings-rc"

   # Nvidia-settings utility
   local NVIDIA_SETTINGS_BINARY="nvidia-settings"

   for value in $(grep -Ev '^(#|$)' "$NVIDIA_SETTINGS_FILE" | grep '[0-9]/.*=');

      value="$(echo "$value" | sed "s/$HOSTNAME//")"

   # Finally set some good settings
