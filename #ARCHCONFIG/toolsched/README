Simple scripts for automatically starting commands as either SCHED_BATCH,
SCHED_ISO, SCHED_IDLEPRIO or nice 19.

Installing:
Put toolsched.*, in your PATH (eg in /usr/bin)

Then make a symbolic link with the name of the command highest in your PATH you
want to run as SCHED_BATCH to the relevant toolsched script.

eg:
cp toolsched.* /usr/bin
ln -s /usr/bin/toolsched.d ~/bin/make
ln -s /usr/bin/toolsched.i ~/bin/mplayer

Provided ~/bin/make is earlier in your PATH this will work.
i.e. adding the line
PATH=~/bin:$PATH
to your .bashrc

'make' will then always start as SCHED_IDLEPRIO if it can. Toolsched.d also
detects if SCHED_IDLEPRIO is not supported and will drop it to a SCHED_BATCH
policy if it can instead.

The toolsched script can only ever be run as a symbolic link. Multiple copies of
toolsched in your PATH will fail.
