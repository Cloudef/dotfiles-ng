# System configurations
#

All my edited system configuration files (in /) are stored here and symlinked
to proper places. Package list contains packages for all packages needed for
stuff in '/arch' to work.

AUR and other sources are in '/arch/pkg'

Packages is generated with:
   pacman -Q | grep -v "$(pacman -Qm)" > PACKAGES

In addition I use these repositories (and pacakges):
   [repo-ck]: http://repo-ck.com/$arch
      - linux-ck-corex
      - nvidia-ck-corex

GTK3 is needed by dwb.
   - GTK2 is buggy without composite extension
      - Composite extension causes tearing with Xv
uim-mozc depends on Qt
   - However can be safely removed with -dd qt

Reminders?
   You should use ':set cc=80' more often.
   Move some tools to PKGBUILD's
   You have job, remember to sleep.
